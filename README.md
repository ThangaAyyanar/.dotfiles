# .dotfiles
My terminal apps configurations

The dot files are managed by **Stow**
```
stow -S <folderName>
```
The contents in the folder should resemble structure from home directory inorder to create a proper symlink    
```
newsboat<folder>    
│--└── .config    
│-----└── newsboat    
│--------├── config      
│--------└── urls
```


`Archive(Linux dot files)` is my old i3wm rice and other cli programs configurations
